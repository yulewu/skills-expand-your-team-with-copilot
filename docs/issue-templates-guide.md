# Issue Templates for Teachers

## Overview

To make it easier for teachers to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system, we have created specialized issue template forms. These templates ensure that all necessary information is provided so that the Copilot coding agent can efficiently implement your requests without needing additional clarification.

## Available Issue Templates

2. Click the green **"New issue"** button
3. Select the appropriate template from the list

### Step 2: Fill Out the Template
- **Required fields** are marked with red asterisks (*) - these must be completed
- **Optional fields** provide additional context that helps with implementation
- **Dropdown menus** help ensure consistent information
- **Checkboxes** confirm understanding and requirements

### Step 3: Submit Your Request
- Review your information for completeness and accuracy
- Click **"Submit new issue"** when ready

### Step 4: Track Progress
- You'll receive email notifications when the issue is updated
- The Copilot agent may add comments with questions or progress updates
- Check the issue page periodically for status updates

## Tips for Success

### Be Specific and Clear
- Use exact activity names as they appear in the system
- Provide complete student email addresses (including @mergington.edu)
- Include specific error messages word-for-word
- Describe expected vs. actual behavior clearly

### Provide Context
- Explain why you need the change (business justification)
- Mention how it affects your daily work
- Include information about affected students
- Note any time-sensitive requirements

### Use the Right Template
- **Add New Activity**: For completely new activities
- **Modify Activity**: For changes to existing activities  
- **Remove Activity**: For activities no longer offered
- **Student Issues**: For enrollment/registration problems
- **Bug Report**: For technical website problems
- **Feature Request**: For new functionality requests

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to add Drama Club"
‚úÖ Use: **Add New Activity** template  
‚ùå Don't use: Feature Request (this is activity data, not new functionality)

### "Chess Club needs to move from Mondays to Wednesdays"  
‚úÖ Use: **Modify Existing Activity** template  
‚ùå Don't use: Remove Activity + Add New Activity (unnecessary complexity)

### "Sarah can't sign up for Soccer Team"
‚úÖ Use: **Student Registration Issue** template  
‚ùå Don't use: Bug Report (unless it's a technical website problem)

### "The website crashes when I click Activities"
‚úÖ Use: **Technical Bug Report** template  
‚ùå Don't use: Student Registration Issue (this is a technical problem)

### "I want to email all students in my activity"
‚úÖ Use: **Feature Request** template  
‚ùå Don't use: Bug Report (this is new functionality, not a problem)
