        ## Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Database Structure**: Activities are stored in the `activities_collection` with this structure:
        ```json
        {
          "_id": "Activity Name",
          "description": "Activity description",
          "schedule": "Human readable schedule",
          "schedule_details": {
            "days": ["Monday", "Wednesday"],
            "start_time": "15:30",
            "end_time": "17:00"
          },
          "max_participants": 20,
          "participants": []
        }
        ```
        
        **Files to modify**:
        - `src/backend/database.py`: Add the new activity to `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Test the changes by running the application and verifying the activity appears
        
        **Validation requirements**:
        - Ensure time format is HH:MM (24-hour)
        - Days should match exactly: "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.
        - max_participants should be a positive integer
        - Activity name should be unique
