        ## Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Common Bug Categories and Investigation Areas**:
        
        **Frontend Issues** (`src/static/`):
        - `index.html`: Layout, modals, form structure
        - `app.js`: JavaScript functionality, API calls, event handlers
        - `styles.css`: Visual styling, responsive design
        
        **Backend Issues** (`src/backend/`):
        - `routers/activities.py`: Activity API endpoints
        - `routers/auth.py`: Authentication logic
        - `database.py`: Data structure, database queries
        - `app.py`: Server configuration, routing
        
        **Debugging Approach**:
        1. **Reproduce the issue**: Follow the exact steps provided
        2. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors
        3. **Verify API responses**: Ensure backend returns correct data
        4. **Test across browsers**: Check for browser-specific issues
        5. **Review recent changes**: Look for code that might have caused regression
        
        **Testing Requirements**:
        - Verify fix resolves the specific scenario described
        - Test on multiple browsers if browser compatibility mentioned
        - Ensure fix doesn't introduce new bugs
        - Test with different teacher accounts and activities
        
        **Performance Issues**: Check database queries, API response times, frontend rendering
        **Display Issues**: Verify CSS, responsive design, modal behavior
        **Data Issues**: Check data mapping between frontend and backend
