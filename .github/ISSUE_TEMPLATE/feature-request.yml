        ## Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Feature Development Approach**:
        
        1. **Analyze existing codebase**: Understand current architecture and patterns
        2. **Design minimal viable solution**: Start with core functionality
        3. **Consider user experience**: Ensure feature fits naturally into current interface
        4. **Plan for scalability**: Consider future enhancements
        
        **Code Areas to Consider**:
        
        **Frontend** (`src/static/`):
        - `index.html`: UI elements, modals, forms
        - `app.js`: Event handling, API calls, user interactions
        - CSS updates for new interface elements
        
        **Backend** (`src/backend/`):
        - New API endpoints in appropriate router files
        - Database schema updates if needed
        - Business logic implementation
        - Error handling and validation
        
        **Integration Points**:
        - Teacher authentication system
        - Activity data structure
        - Student enrollment data
        - Existing API patterns
        
        **Testing Considerations**:
        - Test with different user types and permissions
        - Verify feature works with existing activities
        - Ensure graceful error handling
        - Test across different browsers if UI changes involved
        
        **Documentation Updates**:
        - Update API documentation if new endpoints added
        - Update user guides if significant UI changes
        
        **Security Considerations**:
        - Ensure proper authentication/authorization
        - Validate all user inputs
        - Consider privacy implications of new features
